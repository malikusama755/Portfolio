      <p className="mb-4">
        I'm a self-taught Frontend React Developer based in Dina, Jhelum. I specialize in building fast, responsive,
        and modern user interfaces using React, Tailwind CSS, and the MERN stack. I’m obsessed with clean UI,
        performance optimization, and constant learning.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When I’m not coding, I’m improving my skills in debugging, collaborating on GitHub, or refining my UI/UX understanding.
        My projects include full-stack applications and creative frontend clones.
